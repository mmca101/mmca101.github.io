Hi.

I've always liked solving puzzles and problems. Homeoffice culture made me painfully aware of how much my own toolkit still needs to develop. Maintaining the minimum requirements to run the <b>software of life</b> has become more difficult the more I only focus on developing the software part.

I envision this to become a <b>tool kit</b> to change our relationship with technology - not just for technology people, paid and/or passionate. My hope is to create a framework for analytical and emotional skills that offer healthy fulfillment in general.

My first step is to share applicable knowledge bites and experiences that helped me and my clients overcome plateaus and roadblocks. Most of what stopped us so far comes down to building and maintaining a healthy body, brain and belief system. I hope to build a HOW-TO-LIFE for myself and to contribute to our collective journey in the process.
