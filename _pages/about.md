Hi.

I'm Michael. For the past 15 years I've been learning about cooperate structures and management through the lens of health and wellness. I've managed large teams, ran a restaurant, built online stores, ran development seo & cyber security projects, testing pipelines, company principles, documentation & value structures and worked as cooperate health & life coach while being privately involved in several movement arts and music projects.

So you know, I have always loved to solve puzzles & problems and to improve & grow myself and my enviroment. And yet, maintaining the minimum requirements to run - lets call it - the SOFTWARE OF LIFE has become ever more difficult. Shifting to work from home made me painfully aware of how much more my own toolkit still needs to develop. It is easier to loose track of WHY we do what we do than ever before.

My hope is to create a framework for the necessary analytical and emotional skills that offer a healthy and fulfilled relationship with our tools, our tribe and ourselves â€“ a tool kit to change our relationship with technology, not just for technology people, both paid and passionate, but for everyone.

We can move towards that by building and maintaining a healthy body, brain and belief system. My first step is to share applicable knowledge bites and experiences, that helped me and my clients overcome our plateaus and roadblocks both personal and professional. I hope to contribute to a HOW-TO-LIFE for this current societal process.

But honestly, I'm doing this for myself first. It helps me by providing a framework for my own process and thinking. Also it's really cool to get a chance to learn by sharing, teaching and helping other people. I hope this can be a framework for you too and I would be honoured if you share this journey with me!
