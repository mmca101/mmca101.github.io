Hi.

I have always liked to solve puzzles & problems and to improve & grow. And yet, maintaining the minimum requirements to run the SOFTWARE OF LIFE has become more difficult. Shifting to work from home made me painfully aware of how much more my own toolkit still needs to develop. It is easier to loose track of WHY we do what we do than ever before.

My hope is to create a framework for the necessary analytical and emotional skills that offer a healthy and fulfilled relationship with our tools, our tribe and ourselves – a tool kit to change our relationship with technology, not just for technology people, both paid and passionate, but for everyone.

We can move towards that by building and maintaining a healthy body, brain and belief system. My first step is to share applicable knowledge bites and experiences, that helped me and my clients overcome our plateaus and roadblocks both personal and professional. I hope to contribute to a HOW-TO-LIFE for this current societal process.

<text class="text-sub-like">Honestly, I'm doing this for myself first. It gives me a framework for my own struggle, a chance to learn by sharing & teaching and I get to help other people – YEEEY, thats really cool. I would be honoured if you share this journey with me!</text>
