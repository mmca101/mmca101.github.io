Frameworks are everywhere. They are everything that provides context.

<div class="profile float-right">
    <figure>
       {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" zoomable=true %}

<div class="clearfix text-justify-last-left">
<p>Remember the feeling when you walk from one room into another and forgot what you came into the room for? Or the saying "you are the sum of the 5 people you spend the most time with"? Remember when you made it a habit to study on your bed for tests during college and slept less rested? Or when you had to make due with the lockdown changes and started working out from in your living room or try to do work with your laptop on the couch and felt more distracted and less energized during thr process?</p>

<p>All of those are examples of the impact of different frameworks. They are a testament to the biggtes strength and the biggest weakness of us human beings – our ability to adapt and change. I know its still a very present saying that "people never change" but contrary to that change is literally what our entire evolutioary existance is based on. Yet this ability makes us vulnerable in todays modern world mainly becausse, lets call it, << our operating system is a little out dated >>.</p>

<p>Regardless if you are the one who wrote this, or if you are a future version of the same person, or even a future version of a different person – you probably felt this just recently: almost like beng a time traverler of your own existance sometimes only passing by events of your own life. That result of feeling overwhealmed usually comes from a lack of frameworks to process your experiences.</p>

<p>Frameworks are like an operating system, providing both a hirachy of values, operational principles and much more. Most of the time they evolve organically and exist unnoticed. When the organic ones are insufficient understanding their underlying structure and is key to intentioally build them yourself. Even outside of this, choosing to use conscious build frameworks can help you shape the process of your own thought processes and develop a foundation of frameworks that build on to one another.</p>

Having consistant values and principles builds a strong meta framework across all frameworks. Thats why it can be a really useful tool to not wait for organically
